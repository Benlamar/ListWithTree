# PySide6 File Explorer

This is a file explorer application built using PySide6, a Python binding for the Qt framework. The application allows users to navigate through directories, view file details, and perform basic file operations. The data for the file explorer is provided in an array format, where each item represents a file or directory in JSON format. This application is designed to be highly useful when retrieving data from a server that returns the data in JSON format, where the data represents a hierarchical file structure.

This application is a work in progress, and there is ample room for improvement and further development which may include additional file management capabilities, such as renaming files, advanced search options, downloading the files,  support for more complex file operations.
